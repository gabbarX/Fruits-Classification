# Fruits-Classification

As a machine learning practitioner, I developed a predictive model to classify data into multiple categories using various techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Principal Component Analysis, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. I utilized Local Outlier Factor to remove outliers and applied Logistic Regression to make predictions on test data. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.89 on cross-validation and was able to accurately predict categories on unseen test data. This project showcases my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.
