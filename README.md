# Fruits Classification

This is a predictive machine learning model to classify data into multiple categories using various techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Principal Component Analysis, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. I utilized Local Outlier Factor to remove outliers and applied Logistic Regression to make predictions on test data. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.99 on cross-validation and was able to accurately predict categories on unseen test data. This project showcases my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.

## Project Description

This model uses essemble methods to increase the accuracy. Essemble methods are used in order to prevent overfitting to the data and increase accuracy. The provided "train.csv" consisted of 20 class labels and 4096 features. We used those features along with various techniques to achieve the current accuracy. The model uses various python libraries such as pandas, scikit learn and numpy in order to perform the required actions. The file "essemblemethod.py" is the file that provided us with highest accuracy for our model.

## Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of 99% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying fruits accurately.
